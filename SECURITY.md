## Security Best Practices

When using the WebGPU Video Processor library:

1. Always use the latest version
2. Keep your dependencies up to date
3. Run security audits regularly:
   ```bash
   npm audit
   ```
4. Follow the recommended usage patterns in our documentation
5. Use secure contexts (HTTPS) when possible

## Known Security Considerations

1. WebGPU Context:
   - Always validate GPU device capabilities
   - Handle device loss gracefully
   - Use appropriate error boundaries

2. WebGL2 Fallback:
   - Ensure proper context attributes
   - Handle context loss appropriately
   - Validate shader inputs

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 0.1.1 â†’ 0.1.2) and will be clearly marked in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
